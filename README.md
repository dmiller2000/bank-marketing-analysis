# 🏦 Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a Portuguese bank's marketing campaign data to predict customer subscription to term deposits using machine learning techniques.

## Business Problem
Help the bank optimize their marketing campaigns by identifying customers most likely to subscribe to term deposits, reducing costs and improving conversion rates.

## Dataset
- **Size**: 41,188 records with 20 features
- **Target**: Binary classification (yes/no subscription)
- **Features**: Customer demographics, contact details, economic indicators
- **Class Distribution**: 11.7% positive class (imbalanced dataset)

## Machine Learning Models Tested
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Decision Tree**
4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

## Results
- **Best Model**: [Insert your best model name]
- **ROC-AUC Score**: [Insert your best AUC score]
- **Business Impact**: [Insert improvement factor]x better targeting
- **Expected ROI**: Significant cost reduction through improved targeting
